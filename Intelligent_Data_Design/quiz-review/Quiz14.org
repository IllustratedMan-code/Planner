* A Hyperplane can be expressed as:
** Answer
$w^Tx+b$ where w is orthogonal to the hyperplane
* For n points in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), the hyperplane lies in:

** Answer
d-1 dimensions
* Support vectors are:
** Answer
at  a distance of 1 from the hyperplane (on the margin)
* Given a dataset D, the margin is:
** Answer
 the minimum distance from every datapoint in D to the optimal hyperplane
