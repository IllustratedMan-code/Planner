* A disadvantage of kNN is:
+ [x] time complexity to predict
+ [ ] time complexity to train
+ [ ] space complexity to train
+ [ ] space complexity to predict
* For bayes classifier
+ [x] estimating \(p(x|c_i)\) is hard
+ [ ] estimating \(p(c_i)\) is hard
+ [ ] The assumption of independence is hard
+ [ ] dealing with numerical data is hard
* Naive bayes assumes that
+ [ ] $p(x_1,\dots,x_d) = p(x_1) . \ldots . p(x_d)$
+ [x] $p(x_1,\dots,x_d | c_i) = p(x_1|c_i) . \ldots . p(x_d | c_i)$
+ [ ] $p(c_i | x_1,\dots,x_d) = p(c_i| x_1) . \ldots . p(c_i | x_d)$
+ [ ] $p(x_1,\dots,x_d) = p(x_1|c_i) . \ldots . p(x_d | c_i)$
* In the context of Naive Bayes classifier, Laplace correction is used to address

+ [ ] Ensuring that $p(x_j = t | c_i) = 0$ when there are no points with $x_j = t$ for all data points of $c_i$
+ [ ] Ensuring that $p(x_j= t) = 0$ even when there are no points with $x_j = t$ for all data points of $c_i$
+ [x] Ensuring that $p(x_j= t | c_i) \neq 0$ even when there are no points with $x_j = t$ for all data points of $c_i$
+ [ ] Ensuring that $p(c_i) \neq 0$ no data point belongs to class $c_i$
