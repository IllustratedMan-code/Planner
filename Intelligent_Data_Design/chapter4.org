* Graph concepts
** Graphs
+ \(G = (V,E)\)
+ V = verticies, nodes
+ \(E \subseteq V \times V\) = unordered pairs of verticies = edges
+ an edge from a node to itself is a loop
+ a loop-less graph is a simple graph
+ edge is incident with its nodes
+ digraph uses ordered pairs of vertices for edges
** Subgraphs
+ \(V_H \subseteq V \land E_H \subseteq E\)
+ A subgraph has vertices and edges that are in a graph
** Degree
+ degree of node is the number of edges incident with it
+ Probability mass function = probability that node has degree k = \(f(k) = P(X=k) = \frac{N_k}{n} \)
+ \(N_k\) is the number of nodes with degree k, n is total number of nodes
** Path and Distance
+ walk is an ordered sequence of vertices, an edge between every pair
+ Number of edges is the distance (number of hops)
+ trail: distinct edges
+ path: distinct vertices
+ closed path with length > 3 is a cycle
+ Minimum length path is the "shortest path"
+ minimum distance is called the distance \(d(x,y)\)
+ if no path exists between two vertices, distance is \(d(x,y) = \infty\)
** Connectedness
+ nodes are connected if path exists between them
+ graphs are connects if path exists between all pairs of vertices
+ component is the maximal (biggest) connected subgraph. If graph has one
  component it is connected, other it is disconnected
+ Directed graph is strongly connected if ordered path exists between all vertices
** Adjacency Matrix
+ graph can be represented as an n x n symmetric binary adjacency matrix
+ \(A(i,j) = \begin{cases}1 \text{ if $v_i$ is adjacent to $v_j$} \\ 0
  \text{ otherwise }\end{cases}}\)
+ Directed graph is not symmetric
+ weighted graph = \(A(i,j) = \begin{cases}w_{ij} \text{ if $v_i$ is adjacent to $v_j$} \\ 0
  \text{ otherwise }\end{cases}}\)
+ threshold can converted weighted graph to binary graph
** Graphs from Data Matrix
+ Graph is created from data where edges have weight \(w_{ij} = sim(x_i,x_j)\)
+ \(sim(x_i,x_j) = \) similarity between \(x_i\) and \(x_j\)
+ \(sim(x_i,x_j = \exp \left\{-\frac{\| x_i-x_j\|}{2\sigma^2}\right\}\)
+ \(\sigma\) is the spread parameter
* Topological Attributes
** Degree
+ \(d_i = \sum\limits_jA(i,j)\)
+ average degree: \(\mu_d = \frac{\sum_jd_i}{n}\)
+ Same for indegree and outdegree
** Average Path Length
+ \(\mu_L = \frac{\sum_{i}\sum_{j>i}d(v_i, v_j)}{\begin{pmatrix}n \\2 \end{pmatrix}} =
  \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\sum\limits_i\sum\limits_{j>i}d(v_i, v_j)\)
** Eccentricity
+ Maximum distance between two nodes
+ \(e(v_i) = \max\limits_j\{d(v_i, v_j)\}\)
** Radius and Diameter
+ radius is the minimum eccentricity of a graph
+ \(r(G) = \min\limits_i\{e(v_i)\} = \min\limits_i\left\{\max\limits_j\{d(v_i, v_j)\}\right\}\)
+ Diameter is the maximum eccentricity in a graph
+ \(d(G) = \max\limits_i\{e(v_i)\} = \max\limits_{i,j}\{d(v_i, v_j)\}\)
** Clustering Coefficient
+ measure of the density of edges neighboring a vertex
+ \(C(v_i) = \frac{\text{no. of edges in $G_i$}}{\text{maximum number of edges in
  $G_i$}} = \frac{m_i}{\left(\begin{smallmatrix}n_i \\ 2
  \end{smallmatrix}\right)} = \frac{2 \cdot m_i}{n_i(n_i-1)}\)
+ The clustering coefficient of a graph is the average clustering coefficient
  over all of the nodes
** Efficiency
+ defined as \(\frac{1}{d(v_i,v_j)}\)
+ if not connected, \(d(v_i, v_j) = \infty\) and the efficiency is 0
+ Efficiency of a graph is the average efficiency over all pairs of nodes.
* Centrality Analysis
** Basic Centralities
*** Degree Centrality
+ higher the degree, more important or central the vertex is
*** Eccentricity Centrality
+ Less eccentric, the more central the vertex is
+ \(c(v_i) = \frac{1}{e(v_i)\)
*** Closeness Centrality
+ sum of all the distances from a node, higher the distance, less central
+ \(c(v_i) = \frac{1}{\sum_jd(v_i, v_j)\)
+ node with the smallest total distance (most central) is the median node
*** Betweenness Centrality
+ how many shortest paths between all pairs of nodes include the vertex
+ \(\gamma_{jk}(v_i) = \frac{n_{jk}(v_i)}{n_{jk}\)
+ betweeeness centrality = \(c(v_i) = \displaystyle\sum\limits_{j\ne i}
  \displaystyle\sum\limits_{\begin{smallmatrix}k \ne i  \\ k > j\end{smallmatrix}} \gamma_{jk}\)
* Web Centralities
*** Prestige
+ eigenvector centrality
+ more links to node, higher the centrality
+ also depends on the prestige of linked nodes
*** PageRank
+ webpages(Nodes) connected by hyperlinks(edges)
+ Rank is assigned based on probability of landing on a page
*** Normalized Prestige
*** Hub and Authority Scores
