* Support vector machines
+ maximize margin of hyperplane
+ \(h(x) = w^Tx + b = 0\)
+ canonical form: closest point in dataset is always \(\frac{1}{\|w\|}\) (scaled)
+ \(\frac{y_i(w^Tx_i+b)}{\|w\|}\) = distance from point \(x_i\) from h(x) = 0
+ \(\max\frac{1}{\|w\|} = \min\frac{1}{2}\|w\|^2\) = primal formulation
+ add b to w term
+ \(h(x) = w^Tx = 0\) after removing b
+ \(\min \frac{1}{2}\|\vec w\|^2 - \sum^h_{i=1}\alpha_i(y_iw^Tx - 1)\)
+ \(w = \sum\alpha_iy_ix_i\)
+ \(\alpha(y_iw^Tx_i) = 0\) and \(\alpha \ge 0\)
* Hingle loss
