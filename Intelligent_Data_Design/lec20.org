* Dndrogram
+ hierarchical cluster tree
  + agglomerate (merge point)
  + divisive (splitting): similarity minimum cut-based
** Basic agglomerative clutering
+ put each point into a separate cluster
+ merge points until they are all in the same cluster
+ closest pair of clusters are merged
+ any distance O(n^2) in high dimensions O(n log n) in low dimensions (with kd tree)
+ min heap can be created in linear time, but O(n^2)
+ recompute the distance takes O(n log n) time
+ total complexity O(n^2) initilization
+ n(O(nlogn)) = O(n^2logn)
** Defining the slosest pair of clusters

*** Single link/min distance
+ minimum distance between any 2 points in the clusters
*** comlete link/ max distance
+ maximum distance between two points in a pair of clusters
*** group average/mean distance
mean distance between all points in cluster (not robust)
*** distane between the mean
distance between the mean of all the points in the cluster
** lance william formula for cluster distance
+ consolidates the above
* Density based clustering
+ euclidian distance is not ideal for some clusterings
+ non-convex clusters/shape-based/density based
