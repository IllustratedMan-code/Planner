  abstract = {GATA-1 and PU.1 are essential hematopoietic transcription factors that control erythromegakaryocytic and myelolymphoid differentiation, respectively. These proteins antagonize each other through direct physical interaction to repress alternate lineage programs. We used immortalized Gata1− erythromegakaryocytic progenitor cells to study how PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is regulated by GATA-1 and GATA-2, a related factor that is normally expressed at earlier stages of hematopoiesis. Both GATA factors bind the PU.1/Sfpi1 gene at 2 highly conserved regions. In the absence of GATA-1, GATA-2 binding is associated with an undifferentiated state, intermediate level PU.1/Sfpi1 expression, and low-level expression of its downstream myeloid target genes. Restoration of GATA-1 function induces erythromegakaryocytic differentiation. Concomitantly, GATA-1 replaces GATA-2 at the PU.1/Sfpi1 locus and PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is extinguished. In contrast, when GATA-1 is not present, shRNA knockdown of GATA-2 increases PU.1/Sfpi1 expression by 3-fold and reprograms the cells to become macrophages. Our findings indicate that GATA factors act sequentially to regulate lineage determination during hematopoiesis, in part by exerting variable repressive effects at the PU.1/Sfpi1 locus.},

  abstract = {The transcription factor PU.1, an important member of the ETS family, plays a significant role in the differentiation of immune cells, which include macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, T lymphoid cells, B lymphoid cells and so on. Immune cells are involved in the occurrence and development of diseases, including inflammatory diseases, neoplastic diseases and immune diseases. Therefore, it is particularly crucial to elucidate the roles and mechanisms of PU.1 in immune cells. The elucidation of these mechanisms may lead to the development of more effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and immune‑mediated diseases mediated by various immune cells. With the development of molecular biology, the mechanisms of PU.1 in immune cell differentiation have been further explained. Different levels of PU.1 expression determine the type of immune cell differentiation. PU.1 expression is increased during granulocyte and macrophage differentiation, while it is decreased during T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte differentiation. The present study reviews and discusses the effects of the transcription factor PU.1 on immune cell differentiation.},

  abstract = {Neutrophils play fundamental roles in innate immune response, shape adaptive immunity, and are a potentially causal cell type underpinning genetic associations with immune system traits and diseases. Here, we profile the binding of myeloid master regulator PU.1 in primary neutrophils across nearly a hundred volunteers. We show that variants associated with differential PU.1 binding underlie genetically-driven differences in cell count and susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We integrate these results with other multi-individual genomic readouts, revealing coordinated effects of PU.1 binding variants on the local chromatin state, enhancer-promoter contacts and downstream gene expression, and providing a functional interpretation for 27 genes underlying immune traits. Collectively, these results demonstrate the functional role of PU.1 and its target enhancers in neutrophil transcriptional control and immune disease susceptibility.},
