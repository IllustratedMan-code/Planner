- CG+ = genes with CpG islands
- CG- = genes without GpG islands

# Transcription regulation

Transcription occurs within the [[enhancer-loop model]].

- Binding targets != expressed genes

- CpG islands are broadly expressed, while genes that do not contain CpG islands
  are tissue specific

  - Linearly separable (CpG islands grouped in certain regions of the genomes)

- CpG genes facilitate long-range interactions between chromosomes

  - mediate dual-mode gene regulation
  - CpG are regulated by polycomb instead of Euchromatin -> Heterochromatin

- CpG islands are conserved _only_ in mammalian systems

- CG- genes are much more highly regulated by TFs

# implication for aging

- CG- genes are uncontrolled as aging progresses (both more down and up
  regulated)

- Aging causes loss of cellular identity

- Transcriptional noise is driven by unregulation of CG- genes

# Idenfication of anti-aging drugs

- Cell culture can not represent aging cell types (CG- genes are not highly
  expressed)

- BRD2/4 inhibitor
  - effective for various types of cancer
