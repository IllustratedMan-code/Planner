title: "Peak calling ChIP and ATAC"
---

# Regulatory Elements

- Transcription factors interact with Histones
- Histone modifications forms a "code" that results in different regulatory
  effects

# Assays

- HiChIP and Hi-C are chromatin conformation assays
- DNase-seq and ATAC-seq are accessibility assays
- ChIP-seq and CUT and RUN and CUT and TAG are TF binding assays

## When there is no antibody for the protein

- Fuse a GFP tag to protein of interest, use antibody with GFP

# Peak calling

- Stack reads up (twice as tall as background)
- separating peaks logically is difficult

# How to Choose Software

There might not be a right choice, but sometimes there is and may depend on the
details of the experiment.

Look for review articles.

Ask coworkers.
