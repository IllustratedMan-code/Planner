# Peak Calling

Identification of likely regions where a protein is bound given a set of mapped
reads.

"Peaks" are defined as an increased signal point where the signal is the number
of mapped reads at a particular location along the genome.

Peak calling transforms the mapping data into signal data and identifies the
peaks in the signal as a region on the genome.
