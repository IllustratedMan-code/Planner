# interpretable deep learning

machine learning can learn new patterns from data

- deep learning can learn non-linear patterns from data
- in science, model interpretability is more important than accurate prediction.
- intrinsic interpretation is derived from the model's construction.

## pathway-informed deep learning

- gene data is used to inform the construction of the neural network
  - leads to better interpretation
  - activation of node indicates more activity in a specific pathway

# evidential deep learning

- github: datax-lab/EPICK

- enzyme commission number classifies enzymes based on chemical reactions

- multi-label classification shows high number of false positives
- EPICK provides potential active sites which can be compared to well-known
  sites.

- integration of pathological data and genomic data allows for better
  classification.

- pathological image allow classification of genetic abnormalities
