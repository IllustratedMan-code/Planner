PU.1 is a [[transcription-factor]] that activates genes during immune cell
development. It is coded for by the SPI1 gene.

## Details

- 272 Amino Acids
- transcriptional activation domain in N-terminal 100 amino acids
- DNA binding domain in C-terminal 112 amino acids
- required for most myeloid lineages and B cells
- Implicated in cytokines

- It is hard to identify [[casual-variants]] in [[GWAS]].
- Identification of the casual variants is useful for genetic risk predictions
- effective method to capture genetic effects is TF [[bQTLs.md]]
