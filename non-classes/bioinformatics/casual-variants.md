title: casual variants
---

A casual variant is a mutation or difference in the genome that actually causes
the difference in expression. These are very difficult to find in [[GWAS]], as
there are many variants that are not necessarily relevant to the expression in
question or to expression in general. These are especially difficult to find
within non-coding segments of DNA (introns). Identification of casual variants
is also called "fine mapping".
