*** 1
#+begin_quote
You have a fair coin that you toss eight times. What is the probability that you’ll get no more than seven heads? 
#+end_quote 
+ Probability is 1-chance of getting 8 heads
+ \(\frac{1}{2}^8 = \frac{1}{256}\)
*** 2
#+begin_quote
You have a fair coin that you toss eight times. What is the probability that
you’ll get exactly seven heads?
#+end_quote
+ 7 different ways to get exactly seven heads
+ \(\frac{1}{2}^8 = \frac{1}{256}\) chance for each way
+ \(7 \cdot \frac{1}{256} = \frac{7}{256}\)
*** 3
#+begin_quote
Let P(X) = 0.2, P(Y) = 0.4, P(X|Y) = 0.5. What is P(Y|X)? 
#+end_quote
+ Bayes rule is \(P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)\cdot P(A)}{B}\)
+ \(P(Y|X) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.4}{0.2} = 1\)
*** 4
#+begin_quote
Let P(X) = 0.2, P(Y) = 0.4. If P(X|Y) = 0.2, what can you say about X & Y?
#+end_quote
+ Bayes rule can be used again, but this can also be reasoned out
+ \(P(X) = 0.2 = P(X|Y)\)
+ The probability of X is the same as the probability of X given Y
+ Y has no relationship to X
+ They are independent
*** 5
#+begin_quote
Which of these numbers cannot be a probability?

0, 1.0, 1.5, 0.5
#+end_quote
Probabilities are given as a chance of an event occurring against some other
condition. This means that probabilities cannot be greater than 1 or less than 0.
+ 1.5
*** 6
#+begin_quote
A die is rolled and a coin is tossed simultaneously. What is the probability of getting an even number on the die and a head on the coin?
#+end_quote
+ Probability of even numbers on a 6 sided die is 1/2
+ probability of a head on a coin flip is 1/2
+ \(\frac{1}{2}^2 = \frac{1}{4}\)
*** 7
#+begin_quote
Let \(f(x) = x^2\) What is its integral and differential?
#+end_quote
+ Power rule of integration \(\int x^2dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + c\) Where c is an unknown constant.
+ Power rule of derivation \(\frac{df}{dx}x^2 = 2x\).
*** 8
#+begin_quote
Let A be a 3x4 matrix of the following format

\(A = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 2 & 0 & 2 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \)

What is the rank of A?
#+end_quote
+ Compute echelon form
+ \(A = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 2 & 0 & 2 \\ 1 & 1 & 1
  \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 &
  0 \end{bmatrix} \)
+ 2 non zero rows, rank=2
*** 9

* Exploring data analysis
+ n points with d attributes
+ n by d matrix
+ \(x_{ij}\) value of ith object jth attribute
+ values can be blank
+ Superscript is dimension j
+ Subscript is row i
* Geometric view 1d
+ each dimension is \(\mathbb{R}\)
+ \(x_i = (x_{i1}, x_{i2}, ..., x_{id}\))
+ \(x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\)
* Probabilistic 1d
+ Random variable is a value that each member of population shares (age, hair
  color, etc)
+ \(\frac{\text{universe}}{population}\) is all possible values
+ What can you learn about the population from the sample
+ populations have parameters (mean, variance)
