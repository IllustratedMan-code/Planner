# David's Notes

This is my personal wiki. It is a bit disorganized at the moment, but I'm hoping
to take advantage of the more obsidian like features (back and forward links).
In essence, I want this wiki to be more web based then folder based, though I
will still take advantage of the folder structure for basic organization.
