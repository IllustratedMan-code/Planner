* In the context of uniformed state-space search
They try to examine all the possibilities. They are bad and inefficient for
finding the smallest path.
+ Breadth first search
+ Depth first search
+ depth limited search
+ iterative deepening depth first search
+ uniform cost search
+ bidirection search (don' think we covered this one)
** What is a state space
All the possible states that can exist for a given problem, ie all possible
positions of a set of queens on a chessboard.
** What are the successor states of a state
All the possible states that can follow the current state, ie all the possible
*moves* that a set of queens can make on a chessboard.
** Which states are present on the Open List?
All the states that have not been searched and are neighboring the current state.
** Which states are present on the Closed List?
All the states that have been searched.
** We want to solve the 4-queens problem as an uninformed search problem.
+ How would you formulate
  1. the start state
  2. the goal state
  3. the set of possible moves
  4. the path cost between the start and the goal state?

*** Answer
+ Start state is some random position for 4 queens
+ goal state has 0 conflicts (queens threatening each other)
+ The set of possible moves for each queen (up down, left right, diagonal(not
  needed?)) forms the neighboring set of states.
+ Search all possibilities until goal state is reached, depth of tree is the
  path cost
** What is the problem caused by repeated states during the search process? What are the advantages and disadvantages of letting the repeated states get added to the Open List?
The issue is that the search can get into an endless loop of repeated states.
This is therefore bad as long as it is possible to repeat states.

There is a cost associated with preventing repeats. It can be prohibitively
expensive (computationally and or storage-wise) to prevent repeats.



**  Briefly outline how breadth-first search is used for finding a path from the start state to a goal state?
+ Every possible neigboring state is examined
+ if no goal states are found, repeat the process for every neigboring state
  until a goal state is found.
**  Briefly outline how uniform-cost search is used for finding a path from the start state to a goal state?
+ Examine all neighboring nodes, add the lowest cost node to the open list
+ repeat with the lowest cost node until the goal is reached.
**  What are some advantages/disadvantages of using the depth-first search as opposed to the breadth-first search?
Depth first search does not have to keep each level of the tree in memory, but
is not complete without backtracking, making it very vulnerable to loops.
** How does the iterative deepening depth-first search work?
+ A chosen depth is decided
+ depth first search is done on the tree to the chosen depth
+ if no solution is found at the depth, the depth is increased and depth first
  search is repeated to the new depth
** When is a search algorithm said to be complete?
+ It searches all possiblilites, breadth first search is complete
** When is a search algorithm said to be optimal?
+ It finds the ideal solution (least cost)
* In the context of informed state-space search
** What is a hueristic function
It is a function h(n) that estimates the cost of a path between the current state and
the final state.
** What value is used to order the nodes on the open list?
The value of the f(n) + h(n) + current cost or g(n) is used to order the nodes.
** At what stage do you know that you have found the shortest path to the goal state?
When the goal state is reached, the current path is the shortest, but this is
not necessarily accurate depending on the heuristic.
** Admissible? consequences?
+ admissible heuristics always have a value smaller than the actual path cost.
+ The estimation will always be less than the real value, meaning that it is
  inaccurate to some degree.
** consistent? consequences?
+ consistent heuristics always  less than or equal to the estimated cost of the
  neighboring nodes + cost to get to neighbors.
+ Estimated cost f(n) is non-decreasing.
** A* algorithm optimal?
If nodes have finite branching factor, the heuristic is admissible and
  consistent, then A* is optimal
** What happens when a heuristic dominates another heuristic?
\(h_2 \ge h_1\) and both are admissible, h2 is better
* In the context of hill climbing search
** What is the main idea underlying the hill climbing search
+ You climb a hill to find the local max. the surrounding values are both less
  (or greater if min)
** What are the local and global maxima and minimal
[[file:min-max.png]]
** Select a random state for a 4 queens problem and show all neighboring states
\(\mathbb{NO}\)
** How can we avoid local minima
+ cycle detection
+ blacklist previously visited states
** When is hill climbing better
+ it is more memory and computationally efficient, so for larger amounts of
  possibilities, it performs better.
** Map coloring with hill climbing?
Use some hueristic to score the different regions of the map ajoining the
current region.

* In the context of adversarial search
** How does minmax algorithm work?
2 players (min and max) that want the opposite thing. At each level of tree, the
min or the max is found, depending on the player.
[[file:min_max.png]]
** What guarantee does each player have
The move will be the best based on the best moves the other player makes
** What is the advantaged gained by alpha beta pruning
+ don't have to do as much work! only some of the values need to be compared.
** Is pruning expected to be different right to left and left to right?
yes, consider the above example, no pruning would occur right to left, but 4
nodes can be pruned left to right.
** Move ordering, is it good?
Move ordering can be used to maximize the amount of pruning that occurs. Again
consider the above example. It has ideal ordering for left to right pruning.
* In the context of constrain satisfaction problems
** Unary, binary, and global constraints

** What is the meaning of arc-consistency
[[file:arc.png]]

| X | Y |
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 4 |
The arc Y = X+1 is consistent
** backtracking in CSPs
[[file:backtracking.png]]
[[file:backtracking_algo.png]]

** Variable and value ordering
[[https://ktiml.mff.cuni.cz/~bartak/constraints/ordering.html][some nice stuff here]]
** Least constraining value
[[file:least.png]]
** AC-3
Iterate through each condition (arc), adding the reverse to the open list, until
consistency is reached (the lists stop changing).
