Lets walk through the uninformed search example question(s)

Consider the above map of cities with edges between cities showing the costs of
traveling between city pairs
* Q1
Show how the uniform-cost search would progress with this map of cities. Start
city is A and the goal city is G.

+ Add starting node to open list
+ add connected nodes to open list, starting node to closed list
+ "open" the node with the lowest value, and add it to the closed list
+ Continue until a path is found
** Two strategies to shorten computation
+ Compare new node with closed list, don't add if already there
+ Compare new node with open list, remove longer node
* Q2
Repeat the search process as in question 1, but handle duplicate states
[[file:q2.png]]

+ This seemed the most intuitive way to do it
* Q3
Repeat the search process using BFS
[[file:q3.png]]

+ Add each level of the tree into memory until all paths are stored.
+ This is a huge number of computations, even for this simple case.
+ Optimizations like dead ending at duplicate nodes would be required to make
  this manageable
* Q4
Repeat the search process using DFS
[[file:q4.png]]
+ Without cycle detection, this quickly falls into an infinite loop
+ With cycle detection, its still a similar amount of computations as BFS, but
  without the insane memory requirement

* Q5
Intuitively find the least cost from A to G. Which search algorithm is the
shortest (expands the fewest nodes)?

+ Shortest path: A->B->E->H
+ I found my intuition was most similar to uniform cost with the two strategies
  outlined in question 1
+ BFS, DFS have to search all possible paths to find shortest, uniform cost does not
