* TODO clean up the planner
- Can archive everything that is old on sepearate repo?
- Organization is difficult when the file sizes continue to increase.
- Likelyhood is that I'll never need those files again, but would be nice to
  have a place for them that doesn't interfere with my current system
- have to take into account that my organizational priority are going to change
  drastically as well. I won't have classes anymore.
- How should I clean the git history? I really don't want to lug around lots of files.

* TODO Move linux over to harddrive
- Think the flashdrive might not last forever, and
  I want to move away from windowws. I should have a
  backup at least.

* TODO Pick paper for Journal club <2025-08-25 Mon>
