* TODO clean up the planner
- Can archive everything that is old on sepearate repo?
- Organization is difficult when the file sizes continue to increase.
- Likelyhood is that I'll never need those files again, but would be nice to
  have a place for them that doesn't interfere with my current system
- have to take into account that my organizational priority are going to change
  drastically as well. I won't have classes anymore.
