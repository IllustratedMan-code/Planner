#+title: TF meeting 2

* GRNs

- TF -> gene interactions
- Gene expression alone is challenging
- ATAC can be used for Prior network
- TRAC Loop is an alternative to ATAC
- 20% of TF-gene interactions haven't been seen by the network
  
** MAXATAC
- can be used to predict TF binding from ATAC better than motif scanning.


** Validation
- ChIP-seq and TF KO RNA-seq is used as "gold standard"
- results are variable based on type of gold standard.


** 14 CD4+ T cell populations
20 ChIP GS


* VTR meeting

- Do we need to redo the experiments
- 81 samples in 4 groups
- 10 HPV ChIP
- 3 ATAC HPV

** HPV
- 4 strains
- 2 high risk (16, 18)
- 3 VTRs in each strains (E2, E6, E7)
- RNA, ChIP, ATAC


*** MPRA
- Combine VTRs
- pull GWAS catalogue
- lentivirus (chromatin context)
  
*** Can Skip QC
- Matt Hass has passed them
- Transient shows that tag does not affect physiological effect
 

*** HPV16 and 18 have fewer usable reads than desired  
- going to redo with existing chromatin
