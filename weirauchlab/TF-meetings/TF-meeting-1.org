* Ebola P01

Dysregulated immune response to ebola virus


** experimental design

*** Cell types

- CD4+
- CD8+
- Monocytes

*** Day 4

- RNA-seq
- ATAC-seq
- CUT&RUN
  
*** Day 6

Animals were not doing well at this point, so this was the final time step.

- RNA-seq
- ATAC-seq
- CUT&RUN

** EBOV gene expression across cell types

- mock on day 4 was lost
- CD8 and Monocytes are similar


** Tissue specific points

Higher expression in the kidney


** ATAC

CD4 and CD8 have many more differentially available peaks.
