* Figure 1
- microglia come from glass lab
- Adaptive immune cells, Inncate immune cells
- First letter is Captial, lower is after (sentence case)
- No dashes
- No gridlines
  
** B
- UMAP of peaks, shows that peaks clusterable into cell types
- Shows that peaks are clusterable by cell type
- How many datasets for each TF?


* Figure 2

** A
- Clarify cumulative number of datasets

** B
- should respect order in A

** C

** A.
Delete


** B.
Move to A
- Rank by green (PU.1) and move green to bottom, make coloring consistent

** New B.
- List of composite elements from Matt and Diego
- Into heatmap (will take a while)


* Figure 4

- Union set Categories + EBV+ + EBV-
- use 10 or more loci
- 10^-6 P value
- Separate into 3 excel sheets for disease-only, cell-count, all


* Figure 5
- SOme of the allelic data looks like genome mismatch (Xioting)
