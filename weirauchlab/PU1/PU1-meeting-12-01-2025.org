* Glass Lab
- Data is in DBGap
- Will be hard to submit to GEO
- Het list


* PBM predictions (figure 5 scatter plots)
- Matt will Pick the Motif after fixing his program
- Then send to Xioating to rerun
*** Figure 5
- scatter plots need to be Squares
- R should be title

  
*** Figure 6
- Figure out score cutoff for alphagenome
- SNPmoods score cutoff
  
  
* Supplementary information
** supplementary figure 1 (umaps)
- Get GSM experiment ID for all GEO studies (Rename title to "Study")

#+begin_src R
BiocManager::install("GEOquery")

library(GEOquery)

gsm_to_gse <- function(gsm_id) {
  gsm <- getGEO(gsm_id, destdir = tempdir())
  Meta(gsm)[["series_id"]]  # This usually gives GSE IDs
}

gsm_to_gse("GSM1010843")
#+end_src

- Output version with no legend for lucinda
- Peak bins should be round numbers
  
** Absolute number of specific peaks is driven by number of datasets


** TODO Ellie Kim has Mario/RELI/HOMER README files (Excel)
- [X] I should email them and ask for these
- Make wiki articles



* Figure 1 supplemental
Need to regenerate figures without legends
