#+title: PU.1 gameplan meeting
#+date:<2025-05-14 Wed>



* Act 0
- Harley et al identifies PU.1 as important regulator
- PU1 in LUPUS

* Act 1
Systematic ChIP-seq datasets for PU.1 in different cell types

* Act 2

Mechanism: potential differential binding of PU.1 in cell type specific way

* Act 3

Revisit RELI (disease against differential binding?)

Mario



* Todo list

** Phenotype RELI
- GWAS catalogue contains unecessary factors (non-diseases)
- Leah wants to remove these factors
- GWAS contains many logical ORs that don't make sense (disease 1 OR disease 2)
- GM12878 vs NA12878 is the same

*** RELI
+ All cell types
+ each cell types
+ cell type specific?

*Only need to run if 10 or more risk loci are identified.*

Figure 4 of harley paper.

** MARIO Results

*** Bulyk's LCLs
- MARIO analysis on these

*** Xioting
Masked human genome?
