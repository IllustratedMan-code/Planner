* Figure 1
** Part C
- Restrict this to only DNA binding TFs (1639)


* Figure 2
** DONE Part D

How should I sort the GO terms? By number of significant conditions then P value?
- Yes, sort like this, but with shared at the top, every set moved to left
- Bigger circles

Where does the HOMER_TF_dictionary_proper.txt come from?
- Doesn't matter (this is just manual annotation)

* Figure 4
- Only the ones that end in count (do a text search)
- No dendrograms
- Lupus should just be lupus (remove underscores)
- remove long disease

* Figure 5
- Scatter plot between PU.1 MARIO ARS_GLOBAL and bQTL/AlphaGenome/SNPmoods
  - Ask Andrew/Xiaoting for:
    - Only PU.1 bound heterozygotes (hets)
    - All Mario Hets where there were at least 7 reads
    - UID/index, SNP ID (RSID), ARS_GLOBAL, DATASET, SNPmoods, bQTL (from bulyk lab's paper), ALphaGENOME (Andrew), Number of total Reads PU.1 to that SNP
  - Density scatter plot/heatmap?
  - Flow cytometry density plot is a good example
