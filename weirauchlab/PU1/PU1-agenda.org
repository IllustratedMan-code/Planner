  shared_7_8
- [X] Combine long-name cell intersections (bedtools merge)

* Figure 1
** DONE Create UMAP and PCA (Part B) [3/3]
CLOSED: [2025-07-31 Thu 10:31]
- Molly made the samplesheets manually so need to regenerate with code
  to add more metadata columns
- [X] Matt wants supplemental figures for antibody and experiment
- Antibody already has label, but need experiment annotations
- [X] Antibody supplement
- [X] Set colors to match cell type diagram

* Figure 2

** TODO Percent ChIP peaks (Part C) [0/1]
- [ ] Integrate phil's script into nextflow pipeline

** TODO GREAT analysis (Part D) [5/7]
- In the Figures folder
- Where did bed files come from?
- [X] Emailed Lee about code
- [X] Use fold enrichment instead of odds ratio
- [ ] Generate Tables
- [X] Integrate great script with makefile?
- [X] Combine long-name cell intersections (bedtools merge)
- [ ] Update to set consistent radius (don't need the fold change)
- [X] Add to Nextflow implmentation

** DONE Part A [1/1]
CLOSED: [2025-09-10 Wed 12:16] DEADLINE: <2025-08-15 Fri>

- [X] Move SPI1/ets/PU.1 to bottom of bar plot, and make coloring consistent
  by setting a specific order to the motifs in the bar plot

  
** DONE SPAMO analysis (Part C)

  not doing this anymore?
- Identifies likely partners for PU.1
- May or may not be working on it?

*** DONE Contact Diego
- For motifs
  
* Figure 4


** Phenotype RELI (Part A) [0/1]
DEADLINE:<2025-08-15 Fri>
- [ ] Need to rerun phenotype RELI using top 10 (page two of excel sheet)
- [ ] Need to add Union set categoreis + EBV+ + EBV- to phenotype reli results
  
*** TODO Heatmap (Part A) [0/1]
- [ ] disease only
- [ ] cell counts only
- [ ] all

**** TODO RELI summary table [0/0]
- 

** TODO Mario Analysis
- Identifies allele dependant behavior
- Talk to Xioting

*** TODO Download EGA datasets (vcf files)
- Required for MARIO analysis
- Need Permission still (shreeja will know)

  
* Nextflow Pipeline

** DONE Dockerize/Nixify R dependencies

  Pipeline exists here: https://github.com/cchmc/PU1-Nextflow
- Note taken on [2025-07-31 Thu 10:30] \\
  Trying to implement a nextflow pipeline.

  Already implemented dockerization/nixification of depenedencies,
  so just need to write the pipelines themselves.
- Are we publishing code?
  



* DONE Draft Methods
CLOSED: [2025-05-29 Thu 14:15]
-Note taken on [2025-06-03 Tue 13:06] \\
  Added to wiki at [[https://tfwiki.cchmc.org/wiki/PU.1_Project/Methods]]
- Put in Docs folder
- Maybe put on wiki instead?

* TODO Browser sessions
- Note taken on [2025-08-20 Wed 10:41] \\
  Lee said we could contact her about it
- Look for SNPs that show up as differentially regulated
- Reaquaint myself with Trackgen

  

* Papers to Read
** TODO Harley et al
