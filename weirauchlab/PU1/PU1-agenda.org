  Added to wiki at [[https://tfwiki.cchmc.org/wiki/PU.1_Project/Methods]]
- Put in Docs folder
- Maybe put on wiki instead?

* TODO Browser sessions
- Look for SNPs that show up as differentially regulated
- Reaquaint myself with Trackgen

* Papers to Read
** TODO Harley et al

* Want to, but don't need to?

** TODO Dockerize/Nixify R dependencies
- Note taken on [2025-07-31 Thu 10:30] \\
  Trying to implement a nextflow pipeline.

  Already implemented dockerization/nixification of depenedencies,
  so just need to write the pipelines themselves.
- Are we publishing code?
