#+title: PU.1 Meeting <2025-09-12 Fri>
#+date:<2025-09-12 Fri>



* Clean up PU.1 Schedule
I am still a little unclear about what is left to do in the project.

- It looks like we have some MARIO results to look at
- Phenotype RELI analysis (still in discovery phase?)
- Should I aggregate ancestry or not?
- What about aggregating by cell type?
 


* Outstanding things

** TODO Figure 3A
- Make version with the consistent order as an alternative (HOMER)


** Figure 4
- Median can be used to aggregate cell type in the phenotype heatmap
- Need Direction from Matt and Leah

** Figure 5
- Mario Plots
- Need Direction from Matt and Leah

** Figure 6
- Highlight SNPs associated with SLE allelic in MARIO
- SNPmoods finds SNPs that breaks a motif
