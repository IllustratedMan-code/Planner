* Questions

- How should I handle phenotype reli with b cell groups?
  - Just merge them and run again?
  - will this have a statistical effect?
  - I don't really know the details of the RELI algorithm

- How should I order families?


* Minutes
- Deadline is January 25th, molly wants to submit early

** Figure 3
- Homer efforts
- Families By order of appearance then size in standard category order (match other figures)
  - Move largest to the bottom

*** Part C
- Might want to add sequence logo beside important elements
  
** Figure 4
- Union peaks sets
- Intervene peak sets (specific)
- make extra category for EBV- and EBV+
- Xioting has a RELI summary thing
- add Leah metadata to sheets

*** Molly
- EBV- has very little p values for specific traits (i.e. EBV- is not involved)
