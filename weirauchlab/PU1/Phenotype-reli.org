Phenotype RELI is done "backwards" compared to normal overlap RELI.

Where overlap RELI takes one sample and overlaps it against all the other samples,
phenotype RELI takes one disease and overlaps with the data set of interest. This
is then run for all diseases of interest.

In my case, I have the small number of outputs of HOMER that I am running phenotype RELI on.
