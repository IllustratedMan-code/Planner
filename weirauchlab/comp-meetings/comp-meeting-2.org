#+title: Computational Lab Meeting 2
#+date:<2025-05-14 Wed>

* Pathway Analysis Questions
- Hallmark pathway analysis
#+begin_quote
Hallmark is curated well (MSigDB)
Check for immune library


rGREAT has fixes

- Andrew
#+end_quote

- GSCA is bad for ChIP-seq peaks
- TOP-gene, GREAT (MSigDB), rGREAT
- Subsample samples with too many peaks for GREAT


* Lee
- List of files for EBV paper to upload to GEO
- pipeline for ChIP-seq data
- In town next week

* Philip
- Whole Genome sequencing on Jurkat (sarek pipeline)
- Jurkat cells are mostly European, but cells have too many SNPs (could be cancer)
- TSTV should be around 2

#+begin_quote
Sift and Polyphen are garbage, I don't care what they say.

- Philip
#+end_quote

** Diego's suggestion
- Cell line sequencing could be followed by human cell sequencing

* Mike Lape
- Nextflow PGSC pipeline is throwing error despite a custom config

* Xioting
ChIP-seq QC benchmarks are too subjective?
Want to filter public data (can't manually curate).

- #IDR peaks > 500
- Raw peak FRiP of 1% (ENCODE uses this for their method)
- Establish a hard rank cutoff flag
