https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/help#background&q=4
- Link above shows how to calculate odds ratio
- Use fold enrichment instead of odds ratio
- Look in code for fold enrichment, but suspicion is that fold enrichment is pre-log changed
  

#+begin_quote
 probability over background = odds ratio

 -- Diego
#+end_quote

- Odds ratio looks like fisher test


* Lee
# 
#+begin_quote
Comparing loops between conditions is not a solved problem

  -- Matt
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
The best way would be to have replicates of each conditions, which requires deep sequencing

  -- Lee
#+end_quote


* Diego

- Going through the CisBP table
- Can't find data
  
#+begin_quote
- Uniprob contains lots of data
- We want real data, not peaks

  -- Matt
#+end_quote

* Phil

- Still thinking about DNA corp
- Nothing else to talk about

* Xioting

- Put together LLMs to run on cluster
- Struggling to put together Docker container
- GPU run failures
