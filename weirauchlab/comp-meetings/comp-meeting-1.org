* Details about HPV project

Experiments are done in Hek293. HCT-116 cell data is available but difficult.
ChIP-seq data (Phillip) conflicts based on cell type (Hek vs HCT). Many more usable reads
in Hek than HCT. Likely the experiments were bad, not the cell type. 

** Potential transcriptional regulators in HPV
Proteins:
- E2
- E6
- E7

** Similar to EBV paper (Phillip and Lee)
- EBV paper is simpler (fewer risk factors)
- What make HPV-16 a high risk strain.



* MultiQC

** Kraken
- Percentage of reads that align with the top species (usually human)

** Picard
- Fragment length
- nucleosome free region (150)

** Deeptools
- fingerprint plot should be non-linear (curve closer to 0)
- line with slope of 1 represents random
  
** ENCODE
- IDR = peak calling
  

* Definitions

** HCT-116
- colon cancer cell line.
- Flippin reagents work in only a small number of cell types (including HCT-116).
- HPV literature uses HCT-116

** HPV-16
- A high risk strain of human papilloma virus

** Hek293 Cells
- Hek293 cells (not a great model of specific cell types). Useful for making proteins.
