#+title: wet lab meeting 1
#+date:<2025-05-09 Fri>

* Diego Introductions
- post-doc under Matt

* VTR project (Matt Hass)
- making stable HEK cells
** Initial steps
- Alphafold
- transient transfection

** VZV ORF29


** VZV IE63
- very little structure

* Molly
- MPRA atopic dermatitis
- Paper in review
- EMSA with recombinant JuneB (AP1) protein?

** EMSA with recombinant JuneB proteins
- dissapointing (didn't bind)
- should like to bind AP1 proteins and homerdimerizes
- Motif is found, but not through EMSA
- No positive control
- Is recombinant protein functional?
- AP1-ChIP 

* Lois
- MPRA (genotype dependant binding)
- CRISPR interfenerence screen
- Wittle down plates
- Knockdown efficiency of different gRNAs?
- eQTL scores
- Jerkit Cells?
- Nextflow pipeline

* Areme Diouf
- vTR HSV1
- vTR CMV
- vTR KSHV
  
** Western Blots
- Messy but informative
