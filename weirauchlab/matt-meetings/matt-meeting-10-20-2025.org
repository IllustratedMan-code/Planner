* Draft Committee email

Hi Dr. Wells,

I am a new PhD student in Matthew Weirauch's lab and he recommended you as as
potential committee member. I don't have a lot of details yet, but
my project will make use of RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-Seq datasets relating to
HPV. If you are willing to be a committee member, let me know!

Best,

David

** How many details should I include about the data?
- I don't know much about how it was generated yet
- Probably will need to talk to Phil


* UMAP
- Bins for peak counts



* My plan pre-next week's meeting
- I want to add an experiment UMAP
- Better bins?
- Finish up heatmaps
- Finish up figure methods/legends
- arbitrary p value that looks good for heatmaps


# FDR analysis
- permutations of the p values
