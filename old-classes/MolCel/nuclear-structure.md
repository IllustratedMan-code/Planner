title: "Nuclear structure"

# The nucleus is a highly organized organelle

- old = bowl of spaghetti
- enhancers and promoters are broght together

## nucleus can respond to stimuli

- nuclear speckles
- PML body

# nuclear envelope

- outer membrane = continuous with ER, studded with ribosomes
- Inner membrane = heterochromatin (C)
- nuclear pores regulate what comes in and out of cells

# nuclear lamina

- mesh work underlying nuclear envelope
- composed of lamin proteins (A, B (fibroblast), C types)
  - assessed into lattice
- give the nucleus its structure

# nuclear pores

- 3-4 thousands of pores per nucleus
- donut structure (octagonal symmetry)
- larger things need to be actively transported into the nucleus

## nuclear pore complex regulates gene expression

- pores bring in TFs and other modifiers
- cancer can occur from nuclear pore complex forming complex with other TFs
- NUP = nuclear porins

Active chromatin is associated with interior inactive chromatin is located at
the envelope

# nucleolus

- not membrane bound
- site of rDNA, rRNA gene clustering
- site of ribosome assembly

- transcription factories are distinct regions that have transcription occurring

# Phase separation

- membrane-less compartments
- like balsamic vinegar in oil
- Rapidly changeable

# Most proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm

- need to be moved back into the nucleus
- Nuclear localization sequence (NLS)
  - Amino acid sequence (Lys dense)
  - necessary for nuclear import
