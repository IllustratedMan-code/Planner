# gene expression and disease

- Disease = cell making a bad descision

## transcriptional regulationm

- large scale interactions between genes that are very far away in
  one-dimensional space

# Day 2

## public domain data

- lots of data exists

- reanalysis of existing data is useful

## bulk vs single cell

- each cell has a unique gene signature

# Pop quiz

- Expression meausreuments have a stochastic component
- average behavior (separate signal from noise)
- Statistical model defines probability of an outcome
- statistical models explicitly separates signal (average behavior) from noise
