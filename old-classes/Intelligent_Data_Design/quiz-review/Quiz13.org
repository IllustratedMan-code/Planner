In the context of Naive Bayes classifier, Laplace correction is used to address

** Answer
+ [ ] Ensuring that $p(x_j = t | c_i) = 0$ when there are no points with $x_j = t$ for all data points of $c_i$
+ [ ] Ensuring that $p(x_j= t) = 0$ even when there are no points with $x_j = t$ for all data points of $c_i$
+ [x] Ensuring that $p(x_j= t | c_i) \neq 0$ even when there are no points with $x_j = t$ for all data points of $c_i$
+ [ ] Ensuring that $p(c_i) \neq 0$ no data point belongs to class $c_i$
