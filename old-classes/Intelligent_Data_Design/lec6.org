* PCA review
+ computes covariance matrix in reduced dimensions
+ compute principal components from eigenvalues
+ Choose dimensionality \(r\) relevant to \(\alpha\)
+ \(\Sigma = U \Delta U^T = \sum^d_{i=1}\lambda_i u_i u_i^T\)
+ \(\Sigma\) is just a combination of these rank one matricies
* SVD
+ \(\Sigma = V \Delta V^T \)
+ \(X = U \Delta V^T\)
