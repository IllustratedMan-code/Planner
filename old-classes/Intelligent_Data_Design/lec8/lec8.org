** Intro
+ Algebraic geometry deals with  non-linar objects(Polynomials)
+ more computationally expensive
*** algebraic geometry
+ study the 0s of polynomials
+ \(Z(f):=\{X \) such that \(f(X) = 0\}\)
| Polynomial         | Zeros                   |
|--------------------+-------------------------|
| f(x) = x - 7       | Z(f) = \{7\}            |
| \(f_1(x,y) = y-x\) | line through the origin |

**** Question
+ Given a set of polynomials, find all the common zeros
+ Gaussien elimination is used in the linear case

** Grobner Bases
+ 2 equations, two variables
*** Gausiien alimination
+ Elimiminate leading term for every pair of linear equations
+ Continue until you reach and equation with just one variable
+ Solve system with back substitution
*** Two polynomials
+ \(x^2y^3 - 4 = 0\)
+ \(x^3y^2 - 2 = 0\)
+ multiply first polynomial by x, second by y
+ \(x^3y^3 - 4x = 0\)
+ \(x^3y^3 - 4y = 0\)
+ subtract the equations
+ \(y = 2x\)
+ plug into original polynomial
+ \(x = 1\)
*** generalized gaussian
+ modified gaussian works in the non-linear case
+ S-polynomial of f and g is S(f,g)
+ compute every S polynomial of every possible pair of polynomials until system
  can be solved
+ set of all S-polynomials is called a Grobner Basis
*** Buchberger's Algorithm for Grobner Basis
+ iterate over every pair of polynomials in S
+ compute S(f,G) and add it to S'
+ repeat until S is solvable
*** Geometrity of gaussian elimination
[[xournalpp:geometry.xopp]]
*** Geometry of Grobner Basis
[[xournalpp:grobner.xopp]]

** Applications of Grobner Bases
+ S is not solvable if and only if the grobner basis contains a constant
  polynomial
+ This is show gemetrically by intersections in the zero polynomials
*** Sudoku
[[xournalpp:sudoku.xopp]]
+ Must contain all numbers 1,4 exactly once
+ All columns and rows must add up to 10
+ Use grobner basis to reduce polynomial to solvable state
** Conclusion
+ Grobner bases are a very power notion
+ many applications (automated geometry theorem, robotics, sudoku, etc)
+ critical insight into any system of polynomials
+ lots of software can compute grobner bases
