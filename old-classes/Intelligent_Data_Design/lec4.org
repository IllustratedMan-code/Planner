* High dimensional space
+ potentially millions of dimensions
+
** Hypercube
+ higher dimensional cube
+ equal width in every dimensions
+ line -> square -> cube -> hypercube
+ unit hypercube is \(\epsilon\) in each dimension where \(\epsilon\) is the unit vector
+ hyper rectangle has unequal length in each dimension
+ \(H_d(\ell) = \{(x_1, x_2 ...) | 0 \le x \le \ell\}\)
*** Volume
+ \(V(H_d(\ell)) = \ell^d\)
+ Unit hypercube has volume 1
** hypersphere
+ equal radius in each dimension
+ point -> line -> circle -> sphere
+ hollow
+ \(S_d(\gamma) = \{(x_1 ...) | \sum(s_i)^2 = \gamma^2\}\)
+ hyperball is not hollow
+ \(B_d(\gamma) = \{ \vec x | \|x\|^2 \le \gamma^2\}\)
+ Volume of hyperball and hypersphere are the same
+ \(V(S_d(r)) = \int\limits^r_02\pi r dr = k_d r^d\)
+ Volume of hypersphere goes to 0 as dimensionality increases
+ \(\frac{2 \pi e}{d}^{d/2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi d}}r^d\)
+ All points are in the corners
+ Diameter = \(1 - (1-\epsilon/r)^d\)
** minimum bounding
+ rectangle
+ circle
** Multidimensional gaussiens
*** Density
+ Points around the mean
+ \(f(x|\vec0,I) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}^d}e^{-\frac{x^T x}{2} \)
+ Peak density is \(1/\sqrt{2\pi}\)
+ \(f(0)\) is the peak density
+ as \(d \rightarrow \infty \quad p (\frac{f(x)}{f(0)} \le \infty) = 0\)
