= Question 1 (is it a direct target?)
According to the paper, LDB3 is a direct target of RBM20 that was presumed, but not directly evidenced in rat heart HITS-CLIP. The paper determines LDB3 as a direct target using eCLIP data of (iPSC-CMs).

= Question 2

== A. (What is the protein coding sequence)
