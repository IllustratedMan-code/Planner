  abstract = {Context Dramatic gains in our understanding of the molecular biology of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have created a foundation for clinical translation to improve patient care. Objective To review and contextualize clinically impactful data surrounding genomic biomarkers in ccRCC. Evidence acquisition A systematic literature search was conducted focusing on genomic-based biomarkers with an emphasis on studies assessing clinical outcomes. Evidence synthesis The advancement of tumor sequencing techniques has led to a rapid increase in the knowledge of the molecular underpinnings of ccRCC and with that the discovery of multiple candidate genomic biomarkers. These include somatic gene mutations such as VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, and BAP1; copy number variations; transcriptomic multigene signatures; and specific immune cell populations. Many of these biomarkers have been assessed for their association with survival and a smaller number as potential predictors of a response to systemic therapy. In this scoping review, we discuss many of these biomarkers in detail. Further studies are needed to continue to refine and validate these molecular tools for risk stratification, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. Conclusions While no tissue or blood-based biomarkers for ccRCC have been incorporated into routine clinical practice to date, the field continues to expand rapidly. There remains a critical need to develop and validate these tools in order to improve the care for patients with kidney cancer. Patient summary Genomic biomarkers have the potential to better predict outcome and select the most appropriate treatment for patients with kidney cancer; however, further research is needed before any of these currently developed biomarkers are adopted into clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Renal cell carcinoma: links and risks Reena Kabaria, Zachary Klaassen, Martha K Terris Department of Surgery, Section of Urology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, USA  Abstract: This review provides an overview of the incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a summary of the most commonly associated risk factors. A literature review was performed with a focus on recent studies with a high level of evidence (large prospective cohort studies and meta-analyses). The incidence rate of RCC varies globally, with the rate rising rapidly in more developed regions, demonstrating the effects of increased use of diagnostic imaging and prevalence of modifiable risk factors. Based on the current evidence, cigarette smoking, obesity, and hypertension are the most well-established risk factors for sporadic RCC worldwide. Acquired cystic kidney disease is also a significant risk factor, specifically in dialysis patients. There is increasing evidence for an inverse association between RCC risk and moderate alcohol consumption. Certain analgesics and occupational exposure have been linked to an increased risk of RCC, although data are limited. Diets rich in fruits and vegetables may provide a protective effect.

Pre-clinical studies have historically been limited to cell culture models, however, the identification of critical tumor suppressors and oncogenes from large-scale patient sequencing data has led to several new genetically engineered mouse models with phenotypes reminiscent of ccRCC. In this review, we summarize recent literature on these topics and discuss how they inform targeted therapeutic approaches for the treatment of ccRCC.},

  abstract = {The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is increasing worldwide, and its prevalence is particularly high in some parts of Central Europe. Here we undertake whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing of clear cell RCC (ccRCC), the most common form of the disease, in patients from four different European countries with contrasting disease incidence to explore the underlying genomic architecture of RCC. Our findings support previous reports on frequent aberrations in the epigenetic machinery and PI3K/mTOR signalling, and uncover novel pathways and genes affected by recurrent mutations and abnormal transcriptome patterns including focal adhesion, components of extracellular matrix (ECM) and genes encoding FAT cadherins. Furthermore, a large majority of patients from Romania have an unexpected high frequency of A:T{$>$}T:A transversions, consistent with exposure to aristolochic acid (AA). These results show that the processes underlying ccRCC tumorigenesis may vary in different populations and suggest that AA may be an important ccRCC carcinogen in Romania, a finding with major public health implications.},
