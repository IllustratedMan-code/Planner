* Chapter 1
** organic vs inorganic
+ oranic molecules Contain carbon, essential to life
+ It is possible to convert some inorganic molecules to organic molecules
+ Ammonium cyanate -> urea
+ not all inorganic molecules contain carbon, but all organic molecules contain carbon
** Structure of an atom (carbon)
+ protons and neutrons are surrounded by electron field
+ "orbitals" is a simple way of defining energy levels of groups of electrons
+ P orbital has higher energy compared to S orbital
+ \(1s^22s^22p^2\)
+ carbon has 4 valence electrons with a maximum of 8
+ \(1s^22s^22p^2_x2p^2_y2p^2_z\) is the maximum configuration
+ Aufbau principle: an electron goes into the lowest energy orbital
+ pauli exclusion principle: 2 electrons per orbital maximum (spin up, spin down)
+ Hund's rule: 2 or more orbitals of the same energy(degenerate), electrons will go into
  different orbitals
