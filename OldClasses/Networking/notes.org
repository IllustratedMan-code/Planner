* Chapter 1
** Terms
+ =Hosts=: end systems that run apps
+ =Apps=
+ =Devices=: run apps
+ =Packet switches= (chucks of data)
+ =Communication links=: transmission forms like fiber, radio, etc
+ =Access Network=: A network that bottlenecks to one router (edge router) to get
  back to isp
+ =Edge Router=: A router on the "edge" of a network
+ Protocols: Control sending, receiving.
+ Internet Standards
+ TCP connection
+ RFC: Request for comments
+ IETF: Internet Enginering Task Force
+ AP: wireless access point
+ NAT: firewall, router
** Nuts and bolts
+ Hosts run apps
+ Devices at the core of the network (routers, switches)
+ Router decides what to do with chunk of data
+ TCP, HTTP are protocols
+ RFC:
** Access networks
+ Digital subscriber line (DSL)
+ cable-based access
  + HFC hybrid fiber coax
    + fiber optics connect neighborhood junctions
    + coaxial cable connects homes to neighborhood junctions
    + cable modem has higher downstream than upstream
  + Network of cables,fiber optics connect to ISP router
+ Fiber to the homer (FTTH)
  + fiber leaving CO is shared
  + splitter (100 homes)
  + Gbps range
  + Optical Network Terminator (ONT) is an analog for modems
  + Optical
*** 5g fixed wireless
Data is sent wirelessy to modem in home
** Wireless access networks
+ Wireless local area networks (wlans)
** Wide-area cellular access networks
+ 4g/5g cellular networks
** enterprise networks
+ switches connect to modem which goes to isp
** Packets of data
+ length L bits
+ tranmission rate (packets per time) R
+ link capacity = link bandwitch = capacity
+ transmission delay
** links
+ bit: tranmitter/reciever pairs
+ physical link: what lies between tranmitter and reciever
+ guided media (cables, fiber, etc)
+ unguided media (wireless)
+ TP (twisted pair) cables (cat6): 10gbs
** Packet queuing and loss
+ packets can be lost(dropped) if packets exceed memory of router
+ queuing delay: packets have higher latency depending on the length of the
  queue
** Two key network-core functions
+ local forwarding table
+ forwarding table is constructed by the router using "routing algorithms"
+ routing is a *global action*
+ forwarding table is a *local action*
** Circuit switching
+ end-end resources allocated to *reserved* for "call" between source and
  destination
+ restaurant reservation
+ Signal cannot share connection
*** Fequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
+ Divide signal into frequency bands
+ each user can utilize 1 band
+ Telephone networks (4KHz bands)
*** Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
+ Time is divided into "frames"
+ User gets full access to transmit data, but only during time slot in the frame.
** Packet switching
+ More users can use network
+ Adjusts to intermittent data transmission better
** Isp structure
+ Tier 1 isp is at the top
+ regional isp connects user to internet exchange point connects back to tier 1
+ Point of presence
+ \(d_{nodal} = d_{proc}+d_{queue}+d_{trans}+d_{prop}\)
*** d_proc
+ <
*** transmission delay
\(d_{trans} = L/R\)
*** Propegation
Length/Rate
*** Traffic intensity
+ R (bits per second)
+ L packet length (bits)
+ a: average packet arrival rate
+ La/R = traffic intensity
+ Average queueing delay \(= \infty\) when \(La/R=1\)
+ =traceroute= shows delay between packet transmission
*** Throughput
+ Bits/time
+ Instantaneous: rate at given point in time
+ average: rate over longer period of time
** TCP
+ reliable transport
+ flow control
+ congestion control
+ Connection-oriented
*** Vanilla
+ no encryption
+ cleartext passwords sent into socket traverse in cleartext
*** TLS
+ provides encrypted TCP
+ Data integrity
+ https
** UDP
+ Send message and hope for reply
+ Does not provide: anything that tcp has
+ Used for fast transfer of non-essential items
** HTTP/2
+ increased flexibility at server
+ MTU
+ packet loss still stalls object transfer
** Http/1.1
+ client requests 1 large object
** DNS
+ hostname tp IP address translation
+ host aliasing
  + canonical, alias names
+ each ISP has local DNA nae server
* Finite state machines
** Rdt2.0 channel with bit errors
+ acknowledgments
+ Check FSM in slides for more details (lots of verbal description about this)
+ state of receiver isn't known to sender
+ Fatal flaw (sender doesn't knwo what happend at reciever)
+ discards duplicate pkt
** Rdt2.1 sender, handling garbled ACK/NAKS
+ check slides (walk through each step)
** Rdt3.0
