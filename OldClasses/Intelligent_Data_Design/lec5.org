* Dimensionality reduction
+ high dimensional space analysis is hard
** Feature selector
+ Select few dimensions
+ Feature == dimension
+ Create new feature from several other features
** Prinicpal component analysis (PCA)
+ Remove linearly dependent dimensions from data
+ Gives intrinsic dimensionality
+ Linear combination of multiple dimensions
+ Maximize variance
+ minimize the sum of squared errors (sse)
+ mean point is a point that minimizes the sum of squared errors
+ Line that maximizes variance and minimizs the sum of squard errors
