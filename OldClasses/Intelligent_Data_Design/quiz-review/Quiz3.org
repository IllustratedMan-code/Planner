** Answer
+ [ ] \( x^T\Sigma x\in\mathbb{Z}\)
+ [ ] \(x^T\Sigma x=0\)
+ [x] x^T\Sigma x\geq0
+ [ ] x^T\Sigma x\leq 0

** Answer

 + [ ] Cosine
 + [ ] Covariance
 + [x] $\chi^{2}$ test

CLT states that when random samples are drawn from any distribution:
#+end_quote
** Answer
+ [ ] The samples are uniformly distributed
+ [x] The means of the samples are normally distributed
+ [ ] The means of the samples are uniformly distributed
+ [ ] The samples are normally distributed

#+begin_quote
An attribute A takes 2 values {yes,no}, and attribute B takes 3 values {high,medium,low}. Which of the following is not true?
#+end_quote
** Answer
+ [ ] The confusion matrix is of size 2 x 3
+ [x] If p-value of \chi^{2} test is 0.3 implies that A & B are independent
+ [ ] Since A & B are categorical, correlation is NOT the correct metric to measure similarity
+ [ ] The null hypothesis of \chi^2 test is that variables are independent
