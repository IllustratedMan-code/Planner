* Theorems on worst case performance
** No-free-lunch theorem
There is no single  classifier that is general over the space of the possible problems
** Ugly duckling theorem
Over all the possible pfratuer sets, there is no real way to measure similarity
of points
* Classifier evaluation
Break data into two chunks (training and test), hide the label for half the
dataset.

Accuracy of a classifier is the number of correct predictions/test cases
