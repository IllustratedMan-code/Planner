* Preliminary math concepts
** Sets
+ an unordered collection of unique/distinct objects, usually represented by numbers
+ Explicitly or implicitly defined
+ Explicit: describe every element of a set.
  + Binary set = {0, 1}
  + roman alphabet = {a, b, c, ..., z}
+ Implicit: Abstract representation of a set, a set where you have to "do work"
  + \(\mathbb{N}\) = {1, 2, 3, ...}
  + \(x \in U: P(x)\)
  + \(x \in \mathbb{N}:x\text{ a product of two disticnt primes\)
*** Special sets
+ \(\emptyset\): set with no elements (null set)
+ \(\mathbb{N}\): set with all natural numbers
+ \(\mathbb{Z}\): Set of all integers
+ \(\mathbb{Q}\): Set of all rational numbers
+ \(\mathbb{U}\): universal set
*** Set operations
+ \(\cup\): union
  + {1, 2} \(\cup\) {2} = {1, 2}
+ \(\cap\): intersection
+ \(2^A\): power set, every subset of A (including \(\emptyset\))
  + \(2^{|A|}\): number of subsets
+ \(|A|\): cardinality is the number of elements in set
+ \(A^c = \{x \in U, x \notin A\}\)
+ \(A \times B = \{(a, b) : a \in A, B \in B\}\)
+ \(|A \times B| = |A||B|\)
+ \(\{1,2,3\} - \{2\} = \{1, 2, 3\} \char`\\ \{2\} = \{1, 3\} \)
** Excercises
+ help
+ Let A be a non-empty finite set. What is \
*** 1
What is \(2^\emptyset\)
+ \(2^\emptyset = \emptyset\)
*** 2
Let A be a non-empty finite set. What is \(A \times \emptyset\)
*** 3
Prove that: A = B if and only if A \ B = B \A
+ \(A-B = \{x \in A, x \notin B\}\)
+ \(B-A = \{x \in B, x \notin A\}\)
+ if: \(\{x \in B, x \notin A\} = \{x \in A, x \notin B\}\)
+ then: \(\{x \in B, x \notin A, x \in A, x \notin B\} = \emptyset\)
+ if A = B then A-B = A-A = B-A = \(\emptyset\)
+ If A - B = B - A then A - B  = \(\emptyset\) and B-A = \(\emptyset\)
+ therefore A = B if and only if A - B = B - A

** Functions
A relationship between sets that transforms one set into an another set.
*** Total function
Every element in A is mapped to a point in B
+ \(A \rightarrow B\)
*** Partial function
Not every element in A is mapped to a point in B
+ \(A \rightsquigarrow B\)
** Graphs
+ Set V of vertices or nodes
+ set E of unordered/ordered pairs of vertices called edges
+ Paths are an undirected path between nodes
** Proofs
*** Induction
+ basis step: evalutate formula for n=1 and 2
+ Inductive Step: Assuming that forumula is true for \(F_1, ... F_{I-1}\).
*** Contradiction
+ assume that \(\neg P\) is true
**** prove \(\)
** Alphabet
Finite set denoted by \(\sum\)
+ roman Alphabet {a-z}
+ binary alphabet {0,1}
+ \(\lambda\) is the empty string
