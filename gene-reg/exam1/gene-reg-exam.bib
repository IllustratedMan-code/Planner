  abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by pancreatic beta cell destruction involving auto-reactive T-cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and loss of insulin. Monozygotic twin studies show a 20-60\% concordance with T1D indicating there may be an environmental component to the disease. Glutathione (GSH) is the major endogenous antioxidant produced by the cell. GSH participates directly in the neutralization of free radicals and plays a role in the immune response. Glutathione-s-transferases (GSTs) conjugate GSH to free-radicals or xenobiotics. GST activity depletes GSH levels and may either detoxify or enhance the toxicity of a compound. Glutathione-s-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1) and glutathione-s-transferase theta 1 (GSTT1) have polymorphic homozygous deletion (null) genotypes resulting in complete absence of enzyme activity. GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes in Caucasian populations have frequencies of approximately 40-60\% and 15-20\%, respectively. GST null genotypes have been associated with susceptibility to cancer and protection against chronic pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to investigate associations with GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms in a group T1D patients and control subjects 0-35 years old who participated in the Combined Swedish Childhood Diabetes Registry and Diabetes Incidence Study (1986-1988). Results show that the presence of the GSTM1 and not the null genotype (OR, 2.13 95\% CI, 1.23-3.70, p-value, 0.007, Bonferroni corrected p-value, 0.035) may be a susceptibility factor in T1D 14-20 years old. These results suggest that the GSTM1 null genotype is associated with T1D protection and T1D age-at-onset and that susceptibility to T1D may involve GST conjugation.},

  abstract = {Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are regulators in DN progression. However, the regulatory mechanisms of multiple lncRNAs in DN remain to be determined. Our aim was to investigate the function and molecular mechanism of lncRNA RNA component of mitochondrial RNAase P (Rmrp) in DN. Here, we observed that the expression of Rmrp was up-regulated in the kidney of db/db DN mice and high glucose induced glomerular mesangial cells (MC). More importantly, the abnormal transcription of Rmrp was induced by nuclear transcription factor Sp1, which promotes the proliferation and production of fibrotic markers in MC. Subsequently, we screened the miRNAs related to Rmrp and found that Rmrp and miR-1a-3p are co-localized at the subcellular level of MC, and Rmrp could directly binds to miR-1a-3p. Further mechanism research demonstrated that the elevated miR-1a-3p significantly attenuated the proliferation and fibrosis-promoting effects induced by up-regulation of Rmrp. At the same time, we also investigated that miR-1a-3p can directly bind to Jun D proto-oncogene (JunD), thereby regulating the protein level of JunD. Rmrp-induced proliferation and fibrogenesis were reversed by co-transfection with JunD siRNA. In summary, Sp1 induced lncRNA Rmrp could drive the expression of JunD via sponging miR-1a-3p in DN progression.},
